# Instruction

## IDE

It will be a lot easier if [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDE is installed. Install the community version in the local machine. The following instruction will be under the assumption that the require IDE is installed and is running on Windows 10 OS.

## Run the project

In the IDE, go to ```src/main/java/com.inventory/logic/Application.java``` and select run at the top bar of the IDE and run ```Application```. If successful, you should see a small frame appears. Click on the zoom in button (The one to the left of "x").

### Errors

```Could not initialize class org.jetbrains.jps.builders.JpsBuildBundle``` : If you have  error, click `CONTROL + ALT + SHIFT + C` and go to `Project` tab at the left. Then change the `Project SDK version` to `15`. Click `Apply` at the bottom and click `OK`.
